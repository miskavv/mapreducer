INTRODUCTORY NOTE

By Professor J. Arthur Thomson


Was it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said
that the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to
condense it into little books? Now this "Outline of Science" is
certainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning
of Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a
library of little books--an outline of many sciences.

It will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination
with which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the
nature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles
with a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of
"primers," beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working
methodically onwards. That is not the idea.

What then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent
student-citizen, otherwise called "the man in the street," a bunch of
intellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut
to him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the
doors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an
unnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes
of treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a
walk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called
informal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put
it in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader
may follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps
when he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple
book of "instructions to travellers" which this "Outline of Science" is
intended to be. The simple "bibliographies" appended to the various
articles will be enough to indicate "first books." Each article is meant
to be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of
books are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.

We confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been
given to the English serial issue of "The Outline of Science." It has
been very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with
Professor John Dewey, that "the future of our civilisation depends upon
the widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind."
And we hope that this is what "The Outline of Science" makes for.
Information is all to the good; interesting information is better still;
but best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.
Another modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that
the evolutionist's mundane goal is "the mastery by the human mind of the
conditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth." Under
the influence of this conviction "The Outline of Science" has been
written. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even
more than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development
of the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we
must use it if it is to be our very own.

The Outline of Science




INTRODUCTION


There is abundant evidence of a widened and deepened interest in modern
science. How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and
the eventfulness of recent advances?

But the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is
if the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their
discoveries in ways that could be "understanded of the people." No one
objects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and
they are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.
It is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without
sacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain "the gist of
the matter." So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,
who lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would
take an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making
the world always new.

The story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well
be proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises
the atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the
kinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws
of the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the
disorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus
voyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.
For Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.

The idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to
think of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled
far since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain
ranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and
animals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as
the outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd
chemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a
suggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element
giving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from
which they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has
been so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this
simple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of
the past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a
continuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of
an increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more
accurate student, but a more complete master of his world.

It is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to
be more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the
static to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of
matter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.
Thomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,
have shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore
unimagined. Such phrases as "dead" matter and "inert" matter have gone
by the board.

The new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the
universe. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.
The atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once
understood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the
atom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken
up. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter
are the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as
radium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as
the spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.

The advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what
before was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new
conception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know
and realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We
can glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new
knowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only
of our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New
light is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than
guesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is: is there
_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter
have been evolved?

But the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes
which give modern science an entrancing interest.

As in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there
have been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good
instance is afforded by the discovery of the "hormones," or chemical
messengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,
the supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the
body by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and
Professor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what
may be called the "pace" of the body, and bring about that regulated
harmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too
much to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of
physiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the
past generation.

The persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like
the "ultramicroscope" have greatly increased our knowledge of the
invisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been
added a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which
causes Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many
important parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means
mastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has
been a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house
of life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully
supplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began
with Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself
educated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of
Mendelism and other new departures in biology.

The procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime
movement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the
linking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between
flowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual
types and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called
"experimental embryology"--these also are among the subjects with which
this OUTLINE will deal.

The behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a
provisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science
surpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the
truly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,
and mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members
of the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is
sometimes difficult to find.

Fresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;
precise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new
methods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention
they deserve, for they are giving us a "New Psychology" and the claims
of psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.

The general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise
view of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow
with intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's
continued conquest of his kingdom.

THE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS




THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM


§ 1

The story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with
Astronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us
is imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There
are many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about
which there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in
knowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.

    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the
    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which
    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate
    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has
    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.
    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the
    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day
    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be
    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward
    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in
    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it
    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the
    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be
    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This
    question is intimately associated with the question whether the
    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be
    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for
    our conclusions.


The Heavenly Bodies

The heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their
relation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,
comprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies
are called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including
the Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order
of their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to
the sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically
invisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the
sun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony
is called the Solar System.

The second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the
solar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit
night is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of
the Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged
by terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If
a shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to
the other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet
this distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting
the far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the
distances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we
know of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million
millions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is
double this distance from the earth.

We must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact
little family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take
our shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach
the stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as
great as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The
Earth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust
of rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we
call our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the
surface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of
about three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.

THE COMPARATIVE DISTANCES OF THE PLANETS

(Drawn approximately to scale)

The isolation of the Solar System is very great. On the above scale the
_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over
_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of
time as we use them; that is: Jupiter's "Day" (one rotation of the
planet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's "Year" (one revolution
of the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's
"Day" and "Year" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to
the Sun.]

[Illustration: THE COMPARATIVE SIZES OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS (Drawn
approximately to scale)

On this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far
greater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater
than all the other planets put together.]

Except when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very
tranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our
atmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a
stately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of
modern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent
creeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by
the fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four
hours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a
prodigious speed.

In addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more
than a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year
out, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this
path by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432
times that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this
pull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the
direction in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a
tangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the
balance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her
almost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held
to their orbits.

Circling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the
sun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the
sun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial
eclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the
sun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of
the earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is
"eclipsed" when it passes into this.

The other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle
round the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than
that of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn
into it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic
orbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their
fixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they
are most important, because they are the only globes in which there can
be life, as we know life.

If we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in
space above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in
the accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere
specks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.
(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still
farther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely
out of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And
here you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a
star. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its
comparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of
millions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families
like ours.


§ 2

The Scale of the Universe

How many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will
tell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine
photograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that
pale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true
that this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire
belt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of
stars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and
there, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total
number of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three
thousand million stars.

Yet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each
other, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to
have mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries
astronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun
and the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one
planet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within
the Solar System.

The sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of
92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a
true circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from
now the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the
sun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or
photographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a
tiny "shift" against the background of the most distant stars, and that
is enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any
star near enough to show this "shift." We have found that the nearest
star to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion
miles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion
miles of us.

This way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the
heavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion
miles of the earth, and at that distance the "shift" of a star against
the background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that
figures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new
method. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to
deduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type
from its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their
light. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known
that the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred
thousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.

Our sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few
hundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the
stars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,
apparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray
of light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would
take 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then
is what we call our universe.


Are there other Universes?

Why do we say "our universe"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed
by many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family
of stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer
means any collection of stars which are close enough to control each
other's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be
many universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound
abysses of space. Probably there are.

For a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in
the heavens which are called "spiral nebulæ" (Fig 4). We shall see at a
later stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers
regard these spiral nebulæ as worlds "in the making." But some of the
most eminent astronomers believe that they are separate
universes--"island-universes" they call them--or great collections of
millions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in
the structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think
that our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral
nebulæ are "other universes."

Vast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in
comparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is
on a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.


THE SOLAR SYSTEM

THE SUN


§ 1

But now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our
own little colony.

Within the Solar System there are a large number of problems that
interest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the
planets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their
temperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets
and meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they
originate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the
source of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?

These last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is
concerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,
not so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But
the spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the
answer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the
stars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars
at all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of
the stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have
furnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions
that substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus
we are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of
matter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall
refer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful
instrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and
stars, as we shall see.

    "That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of
    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands
    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the
    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,
    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter
    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we
    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest
    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man."

Such are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To
answer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible
refinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical
genius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the
phenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of
time, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,
patience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the
grandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.


The Solar System

In the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun
which circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and
heat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a
multitude of meteors: in other words, all bodies whose movements in
space are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.


The Sun

Thanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods
used by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.

Look at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture
represents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened
the sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a
silvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's
atmosphere, or "crown" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into
space in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its
light is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the
spectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been
detected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been
named Coronium.

We next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there
are red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one
remembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to
be told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they
are presently.


Regions of the Sun

The astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or
layers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun
somewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these
vapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the
innermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost
nothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly
luminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when
we look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.

Above--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of
glowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is
cooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like
haze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.

A third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the
region known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000
to 10,000 miles in thickness--a "sea" of red tumultuous surging fire.
Chief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense
white heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,
overpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the
chromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour
shoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious
expulsive force. It is these red "prominences" which are such a notable
feature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.

During the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less
than seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000
miles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four
or five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate
of 60,000 miles an hour.

These flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are
not to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun
obscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by
the spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short
time during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have
been witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September
7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope:

    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,
    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any
    way remarkable except for its size. At 12:30 p.m. the Professor left
    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour
    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic
    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with
    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of
    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,
    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to
    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On
    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late
    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences
    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000
    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty
    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the
    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would
    still tower above them.[1]

The fourth and uppermost layer or region is that of the corona, of
immense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have
already referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of
these various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent
layers that we see the white light body of the sun.


§ 2

The Surface of the Sun

Here let us return to and see what more we know about the
photosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have
gained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is
believed not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows
that the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and
go in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in
luminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at
92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous
activity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's
surface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have
to-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which
dilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to
observe these fiery eruptions at any hour. The "oceans" of red-hot gas
and white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by
great storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or
muscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as
it were.

The actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be
the surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful
calculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior
is vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must
exist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such
temperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.
But it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous
pressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick
treacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our
power to reproduce it.


Sun-spots

It is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as
sun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by
contrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,
covering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we
cannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's
surface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be
great whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and
immense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the
sun-spots rise great tongues of flame.

Perhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are
somehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These
magnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic
and telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's
compass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the
two sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there
may be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding "magnetic
storm" effects on the earth.

A surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic
variations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven
years. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and
then diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.
Now this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have
some deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's
structure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their
importance becomes great.

THE AURORA BOREALIS

The aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.
The colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster
of rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the
other. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious
display of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,
but there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic
phenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical
influence of the sun.]

It is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's
surface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The
"equatorial" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or
south. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about
two and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the
equator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a
solid body.

What is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous
state, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and
magnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in
the sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?

It is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of
our knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the
spectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the
source of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.


A WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS

The spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is
it in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe
it fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,
made luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the
instrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of
analysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of
different lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in
ether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to
say--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the
rainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and
the largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a
sort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the
moisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,
according to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a
glass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light
(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of
rainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is
shining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,
for instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights
as they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,
we shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the
one end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,
to violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is
composed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect
which we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two
elements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its
primary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.

This range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar
spectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary
colours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.
That is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its
wave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing
through the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite
position, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the
vibrations constituting that particular kind of light.

Now, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light
from any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with
the spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus
separated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of
pressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal
displays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the
spectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It
was by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such
well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.

Every chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its
own when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is
as reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is
for its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in
a remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of
any substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and
identified by the characteristic set of waves.

The spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright
lines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to
each kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement
of bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be
made to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that
dark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this
being that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot
gas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general
statement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light
which it emits when hot.

Crossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.
These could not at first be explained, because this fact of
discriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's
white light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the
photosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of
relatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent
element in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the
kind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the
photosphere. The "stoppages" register themselves in the solar spectrum
as dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would
have been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as
significant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was
out. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to
be in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were
able to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the
coolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the
temperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical
compounds to form.

It is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or
nebulæ are made of.


A Unique Discovery

In 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences
of the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and
attributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek
_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain
minerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,
therefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years
before it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as
thrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the
sensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our
methods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The
light from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas
still unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.


Measuring the Speed of Light

But this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We
found that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds
to measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the
direction in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy
to detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to
measure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect
and difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which
astronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and
furnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,
sodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that
the sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual
definite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of
the change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.
If the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the
spectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of
the spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that
otherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us
for thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured
the speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that
the vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.

[Illustration: THE SPECTROSCOPE IS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ANALYSING LIGHT; IT
PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES

This pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,
showing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we
call white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is
relieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by
which a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different
wave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]


IS THE SUN DYING?

§ 3

Now let us return to our consideration of the sun.

To us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the
sun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour
from it without ceasing.

Where does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can
be seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for
thousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?
On this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and
combustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical
reaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known
and the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction
of the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,
nor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun
were composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of
combustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn
itself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat
and light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of
such changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been
emitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but
for millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light
on the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its
years. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.

And we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying
merely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that
originated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.
Reliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling
of a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other
words, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less
steady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the
past, it must have some source of energy in the present.

The best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of
energy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force
of gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but
it is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one
another, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,
without trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of
matter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of
the sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all
the millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a
straight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,
because obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop
inwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous
movement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a
tremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the
above shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its
completion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous
relationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if
this were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the
sun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be
required.

It was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun
would account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.
The mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart
from other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous
amount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar
system, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the
sun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet
their doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account
for the sun's heat.

Recent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that
may be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to
maintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms
seem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting
up into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be
split up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?

The question is whether these "radio-active" elements are undergoing
disintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing
disintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we
have another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.




THE PLANETS

LIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?

§ 1

It is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid
or even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only
on planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all
the stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we
cannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and
small to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers
think that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their
reasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at
least of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes
of our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the
rest of the universe.

In considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule
out the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are
probably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet
to the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis
in the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore
always present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the
sunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the
other side must be between two and three hundred degrees below
freezing-point.


The Planet Venus

The planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning
and evening "star," seems at first sight more promising as regards the
possibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it
has a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,
like Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would
therefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side
and the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The
surface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us
by such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace
any permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to
rotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,
and that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,
we can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the
cloud-screen.

We turn to Mars; and we must first make it clear why there is so much
speculation about life on Mars, and why it is supposed that, if there
_is_ life on Mars, it must be more advanced than life on the earth.


Is there Life on Mars?

The basis of this belief is that if, as we saw, all the globes in our
solar system are masses of metal that are cooling down, the smaller will
have cooled down before the larger, and will be further ahead in their
development. Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have
cooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if
a story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of
life on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be
evolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would
tend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look
for highly intelligent beings on Mars.

But this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and
water, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found
there in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who
made a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of
straight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed
that they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or
pipes by means of which the "Martians" draw water from their polar
ocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that
the lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.
There are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the
spring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.

Other astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour
in the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be
simply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as
the atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the
sun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the
planet.

If one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,
one must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles
from the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or
seventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in
a big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the
eye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy
to have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is
a good deal of controversy.

In August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,
and we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed
lines, which people wrongly call "canals," have been traced on
photographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often
not fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a
time when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was
semi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the
least cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the
cold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population
could be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that
there is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of
the very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our "elder
brothers" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our
problems.


§ 2

Jupiter and Saturn

Next to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and
Jupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of
space, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a
planet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred "planetoids," or
small globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at
one time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a
theory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the
material which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the
great bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.

For Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must
extend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has
nine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is
interesting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn
revolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual
direction taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.
But there is no life on Jupiter.

The surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or
steam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently
red-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,
and a large red region (the "red spot"), 23,000 miles in length, has
been visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid
core to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours
whirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of
the sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different
rates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not
self-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but
they have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.

Saturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the
photograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun
that the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own
internal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like
Jupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a
prodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic
vapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in
this respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down
more than the central fire.

Saturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons
(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of "rings"
round it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces
of iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the
sun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a
few thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out
in space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which
has been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would
have combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness
of Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.


THE MOON

Mars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on
which we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is
very faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They
range in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a
moon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about
3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of
these moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.


A Dead World

The moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that
we have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,
taken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a
sense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of
us. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the
globe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck
against the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a
few astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life
or movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace
some volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,
probably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a
certain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and
of occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some
careful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind
taking place on the moon.

[Illustration: FIG. 17.--A MAP OF THE CHIEF PLAINS AND CRATERS OF THE
MOON

FIG. 20.--COMET, October 3, 1908

The process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be
counted.]

But there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even
the photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the
shadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable
atmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and
produced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This
relative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There
will be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even
a meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the
moon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into
a "shooting star," as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There
will be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no
twinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will
be clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which
no man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can
hope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be
visible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,
there will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due
to vegetation.

The moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on
its axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the
temperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This
will be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For
another fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no
diffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not
follow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise
enormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.
Seeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that
the moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the
coldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the
points that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out
of the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual
temperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be
below the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.


The Mountains of the Moon

The lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the
explanation of the enormous number of "craters" which pit the moon's
surface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and
it is now believed by many that they are spots where very large
meteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface
was still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of
gigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's "skin," when the globe
was still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think
that they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct
volcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas
these ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad
saucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,
yet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.

The mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are
extraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,
rising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have
three thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are
continually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,
but there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its
mountains are comparatively "everlasting hills."

The moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It
seems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in
the remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,
but in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most
we can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and
there in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's
long day, and frozen rigid during the long night.


METEORS AND COMETS

We may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about
"shooting stars," or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not
know that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at
night means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere
from outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling
at, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles
above our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick
enough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the
time the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's
surface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.


Millions of Meteorites

It is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter
our atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an
ounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but
even against these large masses the air acts as a kind of "torpedo-net."
They generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.

It is clear that "empty space" is, at least within the limits of our
solar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.
Like the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just
examined. A "social" group of meteorites is the essential part of a
comet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.
19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these
pieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's
gravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some
dark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then
a comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the
sun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the
fierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an
ever-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail
always points away from the sun.


A Great Comet

The vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet
approaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred
million miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours
imaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through
the tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,
in fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.
They may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet
dashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,
then may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a
thousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the
system will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.

THE STELLAR UNIVERSE

§ 1

The immensity of the Stellar Universe, as we have seen, is beyond our
apprehension. The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps
an insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.
One such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is
more than 300 times that of the sun.


The Evolution of Stars

The proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us
through the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the
sun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the
spectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the
sun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star
whose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of "fire-mist"
that we call nebulæ.

In considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly
in mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific
imagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster
irregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the
stages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a
matter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of
evolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies
also to the theories of the various stages through which the stars
themselves pass on their way to extinction.

The light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the
spectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes
which generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).


The Age of Stars

In its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and
we may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also
the order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and
the white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white
stars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they
become yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a
cooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research
shows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst
the oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to
be that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense
mass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the
mutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.
It acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows
hotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white
star. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the
heating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,
and the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the
inverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But
when it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller
than when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided
into two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,
which we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been
successful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is
consequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as
to how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory
and precise answers.

The most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.


THE NEBULAR THEORY

§ 2

Nebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like
wisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and
the telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands
being already known and the number being continually added to. They are
not small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be
given, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the
distance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are
known approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in
these cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of
some nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would
be too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light
would require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a
nebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.

There appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting
that the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again
we do not know.

The more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an
extremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of
the rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are
dense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would
contain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the
gases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to
be dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be
sure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases
is that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not
know. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases
exposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous
and can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold
luminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,
would seem to fit the case better.

Now the nebular theory is that out of great "fire-mists," such as we
have described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is
the only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed
that under the action of gravity the far-flung "fire-mists" would begin
to condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the
process. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although
the sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might
hasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of
condensation.


Spiral Nebulæ

It is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to
rotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn
form centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a
spiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of
condensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous
nebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of "spiral" nebulæ such as we
have just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of
development, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,
some of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are
in intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a
striking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so
fast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.
Some eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,
comparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,
and if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be
giving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.
These vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin
of our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented
by Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met
with universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,
and it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to
hold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,
that the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.

This spiral nebula is seen full on. Notice the central nucleus and the
two spiral arms emerging from its opposite directions. Is matter flowing
out of the nucleus into the arms or along the arms into the nucleus? In
either case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the
nucleus.]


THE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS

§ 3

Variable, New, and Dark Stars: Dying Suns

Many astronomers believe that in "variable stars" we have another star,
following that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light
of these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It
is interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which
the molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick
vapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to
point to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the
received opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars
which periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of
space that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great
illumination would take place.

One class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star
Algol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light
reduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this
case there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and
that every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us
and its companion and causes an "eclipse." This was until recently
regarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself
to us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have
in recent years invented something, the "selenium-cell," which is even
more sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed
dead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,
interesting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered
in it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we
know their masses and their distances from each other.


The Death and Birth of Stars

We have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising
when we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we
see so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast
population of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many
already dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the
universe as a whole is "running down." Some writers have maintained
this, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about
the universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know
whether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he
declines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows
only that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the
future, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming
in the ether of space.

The last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is
the birth of a "new star." This is an event which astronomers now
announce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the
reader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is
much the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but
you begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the
distant "blaze" had really occurred about the time of the death of
Luther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us
across space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three
centuries to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the
fiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten
times the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at
such a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold
in a few days.

There is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such
cases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the
population of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the
sky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our
charts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may
rise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this
distant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at
hundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,
and we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to
suppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole
or in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have
partially collided with another star, or approached too closely to
another, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general
opinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those
regions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous
matter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.

But the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to
think that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which
already existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is
most tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be
content, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has
occurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it
positively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a
second.


THE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE

§ 4

Our Universe a Spiral Nebula

What is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is
a tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,
living on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say
what is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved
equal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly
similar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for
instance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the
insect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were
approximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much
denser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the
simple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the
shape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens
along which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right
angles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards
the Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the
heavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the
Milky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars
thin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right
angles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to
form, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right
angles to point to the north and south poles.

Our system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is
situated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,
near its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series
of star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion
within this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that
these motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars
whose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one
another in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to
the other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these
two groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner
stream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not
quite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in
one stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some
eminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our
own, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that
these spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just
said about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices
is a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the
lens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in
our own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards
us, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.
This motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped
portion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion
of the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart
from these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our
Milky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great
patches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky
Way (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice
in the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The
hypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to
be said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of
the size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system
is calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty
thousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this
distance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each
spiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with
our own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,
we see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our
comprehension.

In this simple outline we have not touched on some of the more debatable
questions that engage the attention of modern astronomers. Many of these
questions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will
emerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince
us that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the
heavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful
fabric of human knowledge.


ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS

§ 1

The Telescope

The instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs
of mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the
different instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two
which stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern
astronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and
without them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.

There is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was
constructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the
time of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and
imperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on
the sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of
Jupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early
instrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from
that primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount
Wilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the
early instruments have only an historic interest: the era of modern
telescopes begins in the nineteenth century.

During the last century telescope construction underwent an
unprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in
the construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the
world entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible
instruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a
rivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,
and each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These
types are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to
mention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is
the ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a
large lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,
at the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of
gigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount
proportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the
tube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and
the eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a
large lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the
bottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on
it to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the
refractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering
light. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the
light-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four
times as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the
amount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,
and the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.

The largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is
much easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very
large lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of
order than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a
mirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor
is also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons
great refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great
Yerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one
on Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures
three feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector
has a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.

[Illustration: THE YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTOR

(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs
1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about
12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.

The great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting
telescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs
nearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about
100 tons.

The new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,
near Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts
about 35 tons.)]

THE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE

The smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a "finder"; the
field of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is
difficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being
surveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the
precise object to be examined to be easily selected.]

[Illustration: MODERN DIRECT-READING SPECTROSCOPE

(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)

The light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,
and the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]

But there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,
great as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the
simple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the
human eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye
glued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The
photographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up
impressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we
shall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint
impressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star
which was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes
on affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made
visible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in
the heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful
telescopes.

Telescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring
the heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are
mounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,
by rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the
apparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion
is effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the
clock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any
length of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such
as Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_
instruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the
same facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite
refinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these
instruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical
Almanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars
are allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star
crosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise
time of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position
these instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars
with much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and
flexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is
comparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;
stars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations
furnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without
them such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance
du Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.


§ 2

The Spectroscope

We have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,
the instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual
constitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In
the simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a
single prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small
degree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for
accurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation
of the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.
The dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the
light emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In
this way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a
number of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A
considerable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that
unless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum
will be very feeble and hard to decipher.

Another way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a
_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a
piece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the
lines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on
them into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern
diffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains
several thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be
spaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there
is a considerable loss of light.

We have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and
it might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different
substances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly
straightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.
The spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of
conditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the
object we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most
laborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these
effects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,
spectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of
modern science.

THE STORY OF EVOLUTION




INTRODUCTORY

THE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING
CREATURES


§ 1

The Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a
luminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past
upon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history
behind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some
measure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than
"understand in some measure," for while the _fact_ of evolution is
certain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been
at work.

The evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek
philosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an
essential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday
intellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and
to the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;
it was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to
folk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has
been applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may
change into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the
final stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps
all the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less
important is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as
well as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies
and brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and
imagination.

Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and
the parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a
process--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals
and plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen
in a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole
somewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler
still, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we
lose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.

Our solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we
may speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has
been _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution
and forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,
our human institutions were once very different from what they are now,
and we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man
works with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling
his actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer
to keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming
in which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the
solar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast
process of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for
the becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.

Organic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by
successive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new
individualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,
and sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our
domesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of
evolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and
the Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks
of present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are
unknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and
disappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of
music.

§ 2

The Beginning of the Earth

When we speak the language of science we cannot say "In the beginning,"
for we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that
did not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the
phrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within
the solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and
the planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The
nebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have
been a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, "In the
beginning was Mind," we may be expressing or trying to express a great
truth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.


The Nebular Hypothesis

One of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown
upon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to
Laplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a
gigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.
As the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation
increased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which
broke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant
planet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the
planets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as
the sun.

Laplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years
before, with scientific caution: "conjectures which I present with all
the distrust which everything not the result of observation or of
calculation ought to inspire." Subsequent research justified his
distrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have
been hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great
difficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings
from the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring
into a planet.

So it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving
as a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman
Lockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself
millions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of
years; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and
voluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions
are undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the
difficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or
planetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,
scattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As
Professor Chamberlin says, "meteorites have rather the characteristics
of the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of
our planetary system." Several other theories have been propounded to
account for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most
favour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.
According to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,
from which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,
the earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,
like many of those now observed in the heavens.

Of great importance were the "knots," for they served as collecting
centres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the
primitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent
orbits round the sun, forming the "planetesimals" which behave like
minute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots
subsequently fed.


The Growth of the Earth

It has been calculated that the newborn earth--the "earth-knot" of
Chamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew
by drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over
8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,
by periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive
series of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But
during the shrinking the earth became more varied.

A sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten
matter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual
assortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials
deeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as
granites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier
materials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,
and sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the
distinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and
oceans goes back to a very early stage.

The lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may
have been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that
the young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water
began to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was
any hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,
and it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter
from the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the
high grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the
material which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary
rocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in
all.

Making a Home for Life

It is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble
conditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that
allowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call
LIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is
ill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild
temperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of
the early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the
earth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,
and inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation
for life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less
important was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.
Perhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second
preparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of
substances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that
in summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in
winter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile
vehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over
80 per cent. of living matter itself.

Of great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the
cooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique
_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,
making great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation
of the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.
We must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar
of the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for
life.


Origin of Living Creatures upon the Earth

During the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature
that we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was
too high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it
follows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living
creatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is
interesting to consider possibilities.

[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF AMOEBA

(Greatly magnified.)

The amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint
of the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of
greyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly
found gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its
microscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole
(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste
matter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]

From ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the
earth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific
description. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon
to do that. Science must often say "Ignoramus": Science should be slow
to say "Ignorabimus."

A second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests
that minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,
in the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered
that seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that
spores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants
and germs of animals in a state of "latent life" can survive prolonged
drought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,
that as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities
may be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when
appropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to
say that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious
limitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of
the origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to
elsewhere.

The third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have
emerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some
semi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of
this view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,
who are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,
indigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,
indeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever
synthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.
Corpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large
ones.

Various concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible
origin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So
far as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of
spontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing
organisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has
been fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one
thing to accept the verdict "omne vivum e vivo" as a fact to which
experiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to
maintain that this must always have been true or must always remain
true.

If the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if
substances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we
should get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures
may have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect
our general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation
of what is often libelled as "inert" matter. If the dust of the earth
did naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are
in a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world
becomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning
and travailing becomes more intelligible.


§ 4

The First Organisms upon the Earth

We cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living
creatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the
earth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest
creatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled
animalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any
very definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can
be sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first
creatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the
simplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and
dissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of
one-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,
or something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which
makes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in
breaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon
compounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably
encased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed
itself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of
which they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There
are many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of
them--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the
paving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church
there was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that
covered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators
of the Vegetable Kingdom.

On another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple
predatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,
water, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not
closed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter
or protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the
Amoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other
amoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus
from very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may
have arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering
that had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the
earth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence
of life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and
the protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be
dealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.


FIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION

THE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF
SEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH

§ 1

The Contrast between Plants and Animals

However it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the
first great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the
genealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of
the ways in the whole history of Nature.

Typical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical
level on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in
their photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,
so that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They
manufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far
below their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any
nitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to
keep them sluggish.

Animals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the
carbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,
albumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin
with, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases
much wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.
Animals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for
an animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of
the upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,
disruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,
the ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding
ratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which
plants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and
work; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the
photosynthesis that goes on in green plants.

As the result of much more explosive life, animals have to deal with
much in the way of nitrogenous waste products, the ashes of the living
fire, but these are usually got rid of very effectively, e.g. in the
kidney filters, and do not clog the system by being deposited as
crystals and the like, as happens in plants. Sluggish animals like
sea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,
and it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in
regard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general
statements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as
in sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is
often a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements
of all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the
flower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the
genealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there
depended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to
speak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the
human and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen
to the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green
leaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic
acid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.


§ 2

The Beginnings of Land Plants

It is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,
and that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in
the universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought
about elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the
solid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the
floating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the
light. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed
vegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among
this early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the
floor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher
there was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken
of were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that
when we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the
jungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a
glimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.


The Protozoa

Animals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.
The word obviously means "First Animals," but all that we can say is
that the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity
of the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast
majority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of
as primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal
complete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are
manifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in
not being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They
have no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of
these words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal
structure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the
tissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have
not gone in for body-making.

In the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were
of the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great
steps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of
Protozoa: (_a_) Some were very active, the Infusorians, like the slipper
animalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas
phosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes
Sleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic
Sporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into
man's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the
Rhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid
line of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the
Rhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the
exquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They
have their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular
animals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,
engulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and
miners when something has to be broken down and built up again, and
performing other useful offices.


§ 3

The Making of a Body

The great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in
Organic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular
animals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago
when sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and
showed, for the first time, a "body." What would one not give to be able
to account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in
evolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.

When an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or
more, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed
float apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in
which the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,
but remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some
canals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand
cells. It has almost formed a body! But in this "colony-making"
Protozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one
kind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds
of cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in
which the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.
This is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in
duck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind
part of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of
these Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would
be the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a
body if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of
egg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.

It was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body
were first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is
not essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.
For the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger
than many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has
nine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in
forms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every
many-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary
way begins at the beginning again as a "single cell,"_ the fertilised
egg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops
into an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in
which a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;
but it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every
many-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding
or the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the
daughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a
reminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units
that made the first body possible.


The Beginning of Sexual Reproduction

A freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by
budding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes
to nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may
divide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is
asexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by
dividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and
sperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very
common. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be
physiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the
body shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into
unity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division
or by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from
injury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to
the next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.

the bite of a Tse-tse fly which carries the parasite from some other
host.]

[Illustration: VOLVOX

The Volvox is found in some canals and the like. It is one of the first
animals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand
or even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In
_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with
different functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two
lashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being
formed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]

[Illustration: PROTEROSPONGIA

One of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of
a body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct
from body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different
in kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular
animals, division of labour has begun.]

Splitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of
multiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery
of a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is
simply that during the process of body-building (by the development of
the fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share
in forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the
full inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These
cells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive
cells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the
sperm-cells.

The advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is
started less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the
cradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is
possible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of
vital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when
parental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be
prejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of
the parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating
consequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is
implied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or
egg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with
a legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to
move in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing
change-provoking cross-fertilisation.


§ 4

The Evolution of Sex

Another of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation
of two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the
female or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in
constitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,
lying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it
seems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that
there are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing
egg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological
characters.

In sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially
indistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the
other is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological
difference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive
organs or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless
discover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine
(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked
superficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with
such contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the
physiological difference between the sperm-producer and the
ovum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through
the body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and
modes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine
characters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical
messengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs
throughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the
development of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity
for vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the
female carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are
kept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the
ovary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.

Recent research has shown that while the difference between male and
female is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it
is not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a
cock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.


§ 5

What is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness
of death? A Sequoia or "Big Tree" of California has been known to live
for over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian
tortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but
eventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable
stoppage of bodily life?


The Beginning of Natural Death

There are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of
animals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by
sudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal
enters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other
organisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to
which it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With
many parasites a "live-and-let-live" compromise is arrived at, but new
parasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is
bitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a
Trypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the
parasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if
the host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in
the so-called "grouse disease," and become fatal. (_c_) But besides
violent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.
This is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A
body worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this
implies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in
which the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the
living matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it
works--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various
processes of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,
which work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or
later the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death
is to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for
many animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the
nemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a
large degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural
death. They are so relatively simple that they can continually
recuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.
Moreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many
units, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some
measure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple
many-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here
is an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of
evading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case
of the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in
liberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice
of the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.

Along with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be
considered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best
suited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the
life-history to suit various conditions.

The centrosome introduced by the spermatozoon has divided into two
centrosomes, one at each pole of the nucleus. These play an important
part in the division or segmentation of the egg.

8. The fertilised egg has divided into two cells. Each cell has 2
paternal and 2 maternal chromosomes.]

The Cerebrum, the seat of intelligence, increases in proportion to the
other parts. In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,
which lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.
In birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]

Great Acquisitions

In animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the
body is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body
might be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited
for sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit
of moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to
man the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a
right and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.
This kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial
animals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for
chasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be
associated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is
to be found in some simple worm-types.

Among the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice: a
well-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large
internal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the
food-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of
muscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium
throughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to
which they also contribute.

Another very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)
to backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of
internal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These
manufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the
blood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating
and harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers
are called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater
activity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some
regulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition
of the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of
the body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate
trigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a
mammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting
outcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.


THE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR

§ 1

Before passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher
and higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the
procession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider
the evolution of animal behaviour.


Evolution of Mind

A human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which
there is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long
period of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership
between mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one
can make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even
after birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin
with, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,
and it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality
cannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the
potentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from
the very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,
feeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known
to us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must
be implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit
in a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the
individual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of
that aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We
cannot put our finger on any point and say: Before this stage there was
no mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there
is life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be
more accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we
call life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.

[Illustration: OKAPI AND GIRAFFE

The Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good
idea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown
until discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where
these strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time
immemorial.]

In another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in
backboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be
called the inclined plane of animal behaviour.

A very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and
it proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its
environment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative
fashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without
being blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it
remains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of
life. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or
self-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.
When a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen
under a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring
a field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of
something corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its
activity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues
another amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,
recaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of
the animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a
basin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got
loose and "taken charge" on board ship. Another feature is that the
locomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct
individuality: it may swim, for instance, in a loose spiral.

But there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the
surrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from
without. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of
the shield: the environment acts upon the organism; that is the other
side. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of
what we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history
of animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more
advantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its
influences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways
to knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an
earthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.


The Trial and Error Method

Simple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their
environment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.
Animals come to have definite "answers back," sometimes several,
sometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which
reverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing
influence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off
again in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the
previous line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if
it strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way
out is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.

It may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every
question, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered
reactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one
after another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error
method, and a higher note is struck.

There is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When
the creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right
answer first, there is the beginning of learning.

THE YUCCA MOTH

The Yucca Moth, emerging from her cocoon, flies at night to a Yucca
flower and collects pollen from the stamens, holding a little ball of it
in her mouth-parts. She then visits another flower and lays an egg in
the seed-box. After this she applies the pollen to the tip of the
pistil, thus securing the fertilisation of the flower and the growth of
the ovules in the pod. Yucca flowers in Britain do not produce seeds
because there are no Yucca Moths.]

VENUS' FLY-TRAP

One of the most remarkable plants in the world, which captures its prey
by means of a trap formed from part of its leaf. It has been induced to
snap at and hold a bristle. If an insect lighting on the leaf touches
one of six very sensitive hairs, which pull the trigger of the movement,
the two halves of the leaf close rapidly and the fringing teeth on the
margin interlock, preventing the insect's escape. Then follows an
exudation of digestive juice.]

A kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her
nest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up
towards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary
proceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]


Reflex Actions

Among simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the
beginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour
of the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in
the animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of
nerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer
is given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of
its burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and
jerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say "reflex action."
What is it that happens?

Certain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by
vibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre
from each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory
fibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,
associative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with
motor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor
nerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one
from each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to
happen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much
use to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus
almost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or
enregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically
ready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary
that the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the
animal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher
controlling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being
given, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on
some solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the
expression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we
ascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated
and often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the
trigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the
insectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect
is like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite
nervous system.


What are Called Tropisms

A somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are
called "tropisms," obligatory movements which the animal makes,
adjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in
relation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,
electricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;
the eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological
inequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the
outcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both
eyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the
candle.

It may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but
the flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no
one can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle
in animal behaviour.


§ 2

Instinctive Behaviour

On a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such
remarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical
expression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does
not require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,
though it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members
of the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often
different from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life
that are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a
lifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca
flower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,
collects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,
and stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower
and lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before
she does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From
this the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube
fertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become
real seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has
destroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that
the Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she
secures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which
form part of her instinctive repertory.

From a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain
of compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason
to believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by
endeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped
routine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also
be noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases
purely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of
trial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and
mammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive
routine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of
intelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive
element. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally
intelligent, and that instinct is "lapsed intelligence," is a tempting
one, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions
cease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on
the unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be
entailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of
evolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to
the inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius
than to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.


Animal Intelligence

The higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence
in the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot
be described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of
perceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by
ideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they
are plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection
with instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the
creature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular
circumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative
awareness of relations.

When there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is
_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of
Reason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is
not, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he
has the possibility of it ever within his reach.

Animal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of
this work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the
evolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental
behaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has
been part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary
enregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being
that the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,
if it chooses, for higher adventures.

There is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution
animals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of
behaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more
definitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the
behaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has
come to count for more and more.


§ 3

Evolution of Parental Care

Mammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which
expresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young
at a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated
with a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish
called _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and
there are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some
other fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the
problem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number
of eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous
infantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.

But some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an
entirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care
and they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a
trend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So
much so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size
and frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of
evolution to which the animal has attained.

Now there are many different methods of parental care which secure the
safety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young
ones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well
advanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the
young a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly
reduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction
of economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for
existence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of
parental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.

In the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face
a modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the
environing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many
months within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.
There are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are
exceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific
though viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated
with a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,
for although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being
embryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and
therefore a huge family.

Viviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial
animals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its
climax among mammals.

Now it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the
Duckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that
the Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,
prematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;
while all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal
life and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn
young.


§ 4

There is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It
has implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a
progressive conquest of the environment.

1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in
the stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,
brightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This
littoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,
earth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant
oxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the
streams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.

PERIPATUS

A widely distributed old-fashioned type of animal, somewhat like a
permanent caterpillar. It has affinities both with worms and with
insects. It has a velvety skin, minute diamond-like eyes, and short
stump-like legs. A defenceless, weaponless animal, it comes out at
night, and is said to capture small insects by squirting jets of slime
from its mouth.]

ROCK KANGAROO CARRYING ITS YOUNG IN A POUCH

The young are born so helpless that they cannot even suck. The mother
places them in the external pouch, and fitting their mouths on the teats
injects the milk. After a time the young ones go out and in as they
please.]

It is not an easy haunt of life, but none the worse for that, and it is
tenanted to-day by representatives of practically every class of animals
from infusorians to seashore birds and mammals.


The Cradle of the Open Sea

2. The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined
surface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.

It is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no
crowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for
animals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating "sea-meadows" of
microscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the
open-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn
making life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and
toothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original
cradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long
period of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water
to allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this
view that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their
youthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only
return to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they
have gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say
that the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the
shore of the sea and the open sea.


The Great Deeps

3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,
which occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a
region of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal
night--relieved only by the fitful gleams of "phosphorescent" animals;
of enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500
fathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as
there are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one
another, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which
sink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very
unpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives
us a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the
difficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.
It is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in
relatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very
antique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due
to littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after
millennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.


The Freshwaters

4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river
and lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by
gradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage
from the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some
cases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually
turned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters
is very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the
characteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of
being frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry
after floods or of being swept down to the sea.


Conquest of the Dry Land

5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents
from the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm
invasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the
invasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the
important linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the
invasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the
higher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and
family affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor
ones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a
widespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to
possess the dry land.

Getting on to dry land had a manifold significance.

It implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen
than there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more
difficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well
protected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry
ground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such
as those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed
by the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of
oxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different
idea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of
oxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes
takes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this
thorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's
intense activity. The blood never becomes impure.

The conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of
locomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed
along by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also
followed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal
tended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or
adjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface
trailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in
the water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as
earthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the
earthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the
centipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake
pushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the
lower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.


Methods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life

A great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that
locomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the
earth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the
animal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in
three dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land
animals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in
some other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals
have very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on
the ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the
sea.

Land animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,
but these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the
hairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of
tortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly
necessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs
meet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded
retreat.

Another consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young
can no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is
surrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the
eggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are
many that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways
in which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying
them in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them
about for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean
great safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a
small family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and
the kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of
the land many far-reaching consequences have followed.

Finally, it is worth dwelling on the risks of terrestrial life, because
they enable us better to understand why so many land animals have become
burrowers and others climbers of trees, why some have returned to the
water and others have taken to the air. It may be asked, perhaps, why
the land should have been colonised at all when the risks and
difficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and
curiosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water
because the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because
of inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of
adventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of
progress.


Conquering the Air

6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be
placed to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These
have been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been
many brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than
parachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the
water and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,
holding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a
slight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that
skims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon
(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.
Among mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more
besides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating
the endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his
own.

The power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the
ground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into
the air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;
the eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in
their migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.
Many of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of
the Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not
stand alone.


THE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES

§ 1

The Rock Record

How do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were
established on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance
and the succession of their advances? The answer is: by reading the Rock
Record. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated
into continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the
land has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler
hills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by
air and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been
borne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as
deposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar
sedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus
been broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total
thickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to
some geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a
small part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the
deposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.


The Use of Fossils

When the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came
about that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were
buried, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible
to read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence
the geologist is able to determine the order in which the different
sedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that
the Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other
cases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the
order of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the
simpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more
complex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of
strata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before
there were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and
reptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of
fossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been
clearly worked out.

If the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and
animals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be
easy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to
become satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many
were destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a
library very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.


§ 2

The Geological Time-table

The long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently
divided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and
modern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and
Cenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.

Geologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the
process of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how
long has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,
for all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to
fall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is
contributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million
years as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of
salt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of
the geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all
likelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long
it would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and
mudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though
the _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials
have come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual
amount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required
for the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be
approximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell
the earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no
certainty has been reached.

The eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_
correspond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the
subsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about
twenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million
years must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the
Palæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand
total of sixty millions.


The Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks

It is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the
Archæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living
creatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter
part of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine
animals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed
in the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive
creatures the rock record tells us little.

Sea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]

[Illustration: _Photo: J. J. Ward, F.E.S._

A TRILOBITE

Trilobites were ancient seashore animals, abundant from the Upper
Cambrian to the Carboniferous eras. They have no direct descendants
to-day. They were jointed-footed animals, allied to Crustaceans and
perhaps also to King-crabs. They were able to roll themselves up in
their ring-armour.]

[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)._

THE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS

It can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also
breathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.
It is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process. For seven
months of the year, the dry season, it can remain inert in the mud,
getting air through an open pipe to the surface. When water fills the
pools it can use its gills again. Mud-nests or mud encasements with the
lung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when
liberated were quite lively.]

[Illustration: THE ARCHÆOPTERYX

(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)

A good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic
Era). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had
claws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.
But it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]

[Illustration: WING OF A BIRD, SHOWING THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FEATHERS

The longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2
and 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries
are borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft
(AS) on the thumb (TH).]

The rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to
the fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it
must also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and
repeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did
exist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what
right we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence
or extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of
limestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to
deposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming
Bacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants
flourished in these ancient days.


§ 3

The Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)

The _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief
stocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,
sea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There
is something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the
seas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor
H. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a
colonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.

The _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the
once very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,
antenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and
a covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the
Palæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory
cuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period
that the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making
step in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in
the course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)
in dominating the seas.

In the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on
apace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For
in Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability
to breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as
lungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of
great aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or
double-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,
again, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do
when the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes
or mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one
in South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely
interesting "living fossils," binding the class of fishes to that of
amphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry
land should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the
second great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,
like the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.

progressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]

The _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one
of the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the
time of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of
terrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the
discoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known
Amphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of
the dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that
the first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that
they came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there
was a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in
the Devonian seas.


EVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS

§ 1

Giant Amphibians and Coal-measures

The _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a
luxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less
strenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.
There were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of
club-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with
their pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the
jointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of
centipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval
Amphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of
far-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering
plants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be
said that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.
Cross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and
cross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because
it promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this
period that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to
justify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the
monotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered
great tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous
forests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor
invasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.
They, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which
attained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the
Carboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were
almost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this
period that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense
accumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages
afterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of
energy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even
then it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!


The Acquisitions of Amphibians.

As Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may
fitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which
the emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage
from water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful
life, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question
rises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all
when great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers
must be: (_a_) that local drying up of water-basins or elevations of the
land surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may
have been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and
(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being
throughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,
migrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by
over-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for
the first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by
limbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of
grasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling
things in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the
soft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they
were in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of
the present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the
following: true ventral lungs, a three-chambered heart, a movable
tongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting
to find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in
it, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue
of fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole
becomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible
for the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This
is probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of
millennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition
made by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid
passage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the
larynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was
upon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,
thunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some
insects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds
were due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely
one of the great steps in organic evolution.

three-horned skull with a remarkable bony collar over the neck. But, as
in many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed
down the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly
accounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]

[Illustration: _Photo: "Daily Mail."_

THE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA

The Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the
most primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an
egg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly
warm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can
also burrow.]


Evolution of the Voice

The first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and
toads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting
with which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males
that the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past
Amphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call
helping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young
birds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later
on, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched
crocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the
mother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses
emotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the
breeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying
particular things or feelings, such as "food," "danger," "home,"
"anger," and "joy." Finally words become a medium of social intercourse
and as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.


§ 2

The Early Reptiles

In the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,
began to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of
backboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method
of breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages
at least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a
vascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from
without. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the
allantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder
growing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in
evolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal
membrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,
which forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total
emancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two
foetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in
all reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates
are therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or
Anamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).

It is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and
mammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic
ancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration
and show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds
where their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the
gill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the
first becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the
back of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any
use, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret
except in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering
influence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency
that individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a
condensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a
million years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!

In the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the
Carboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in
an Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the
world. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and
the appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and
cycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The
Permian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the
Far South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North
Europe was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and
Australia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many
of the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the
feeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,
and the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted
for reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,
well-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with
as a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an
animal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.


Disappearance of many Ancient Types

We cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged
ice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large
number of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless
animals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand
that the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to
those of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living
representatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much
changed and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,
_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near
relative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely
conservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living
representatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the
King-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the
otherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions
belonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which
have left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day
of such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.

Looking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the
Palæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There
was in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of
backboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps
the first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of
air-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the
appearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals
are descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the
_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of
air-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first
reptiles and a new flora.


THE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES

§ 1

The Mesozoic Era

In a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of
reptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was
established in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern
flowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like
birds and mammals among the great reptiles.

In the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked
the Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there
were Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which
lasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the
Dinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the
limits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must
look for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water
were dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had
there been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very
sagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the
climax of creation.


The Flying Dragons

The _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.
They radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus
there were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of
terrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding
alligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic
attained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the
extension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost
finger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over
five feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was
an adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not
more than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that
they could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of
flight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of
the keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the
muscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like
the ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the
burrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have "gone
back."


The First Known Bird

But the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have
yielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.
These were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained
lithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body
is preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their
marks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be
the first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of
arboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so
pronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had
teeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like
tail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a
sort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all
modern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of
the palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis
for the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are
peculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the
so-called "abdominal ribs," and it seems an eloquent detail to find
these represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern
bird shows any trace of them. [Illustration: SKELETON OF AN EXTINCT
FLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS

(_After Marsh._)

The bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,
with a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp
teeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient
type.]

INCREASE IN SIZE

(_After Lull and Matthew._)

America.

2. Another four-toed horse, Orohippus, a little over a foot high. Middle

3. Three-toed horse, Mesohippus, about the size of a sheep. Middle
Oligocene, N. America.

4. Three-toed horse, Merychippus, Miocene, N. America. Only one toe
reaches the ground on each foot, but the remains of two others are
prominent.

5. The first one-toed horse, Pliohippus, about forty inches high at the
shoulder. Pliocene, N. America.

6. The modern horse, running on the third digit of each foot.]

There is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or
Pterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different
lines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the
long-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of
the bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable
that birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and
it is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took "flying
jumps" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal
apprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree
before true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the
problem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,
by Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are
on entirely different lines.

In the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of
giant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the
multiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as
the dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was
probably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.
Comparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that
their back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but
they were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal
insectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),
began to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions
of modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the
race of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an
exuberant "radiation" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts
of haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.

There is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite
mammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.
For although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals
ourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which
birds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary
structures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals
are on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one
another, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,
there is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the
first bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any
record. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own
before mammals did.

Looking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the
Mesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence: "The Mesozoic is the Age
of Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are
storing up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the
cycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants."


§ 2

The Cenozoic or Tertiary Era

In the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained
archaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be
associated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry
pasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing
mammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a
richer evolution of insects and birds.

During the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate
became much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.

The _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning
examples of what Osborn calls "adaptive radiation." That is to say,
mammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.
There are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like
sloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the
moles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting
seals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more
than full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial
tendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of
opportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of
animals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the
experiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises
what is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated
types, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact
that the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of
life. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of
the twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may
be six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate
everywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.


§ 3

The _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial
climatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges
were broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution
underwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_
as "a period of great unrest." "Many migrations occurred the world over,
new competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects
of the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the
Pliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity
into man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution."

The _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued
elevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by
less severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards
for a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the
sabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.
Others which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far
North or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like
the Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the
snow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the
Northern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of
migration.

Looking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again:

    "The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more
    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is
    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects
    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands
    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there
    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal
    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man
    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial
    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and
    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his
    brute associates."

In man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.


The Ascent of Man

Man stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas
and of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of
his conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of
language as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man
has language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_
inference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference
(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and
industrious, but man "thinks the ought," definitely guiding his conduct
in the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that
he is "a social person."

Besides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a
gorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he
plants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good
heel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set
of teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.

disappear.]

[Illustration: A. Fore-limb of Monkey B. Fore-limb of Whale

WHAT IS MEANT BY HOMOLOGY? ESSENTIAL SIMILARITY OF ARCHITECTURE, THOUGH
THE APPEARANCES MAY BE VERY DIFFERENT

This is seen in comparing these two fore-limbs, A, of Monkey, B, of
Whale. They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,
e.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R
and U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;
and then the fingers.]

But in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his
solidarity with the rest of creation. There is an "all-pervading
similitude of structure," between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it
is certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.
None of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be
called momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial
structures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily
life and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.
Even his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some
fossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.

It is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of
Darwin's _Descent of Man_:

    "We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with
    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most
    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to
    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has
    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar
    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily
    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."


THE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE

There is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often
overlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital
inter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often
vitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and
distribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the
juvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the
vehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping
sickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the
unconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called
the bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious
co-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial
partnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other
inter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of
insects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals
many forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains
bind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the
whelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a
system of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from
one embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate
the central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System
of Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the
orderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but
we owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema
Naturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and
more complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex
of all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an
external method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving
set of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures
are kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.


Parasitism

It sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one
living creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the
case with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an
easygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,
requiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to
effort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;
everything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living
creatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the
animal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly
is--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.

This is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the
establishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,
temporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying
boarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's
food and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food
there. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch
inside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as
"beasts of prey" working from within.

But there are two sides to this minor chapter: there is the evolution of
the parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures
on the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of
wandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body
and often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there
is the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic
substances or "anti-bodies" which counteract poisons, including the
poisons which the intruding parasites often make.


THE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT

§ 1

Progress in Evolution

There has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of
evolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For
millions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we
compare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,
we must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their
fate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that
is to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards
harmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can
discern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller
embodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,
understanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has
been chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards
increasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this
advance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much
for Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.


Evidences of Evolution

In all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for
granted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly
answered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of
the past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may
prove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is
a key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock
that it does not open.

But if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called
the evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is
_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact
that fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and
these before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil
series, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in
process. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general
very convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases
in regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how
Vertebrates arose or from what origin?

There is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often
reads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of
the race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote
aquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to
the historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of
to-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The
individual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or
sole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its
ancestors were symmetrical fishes.

There is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants
and animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on
around us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and
cultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need
hardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that
change need not be expected when a positi
